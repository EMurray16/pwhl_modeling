Modeling PWHL outcomes using league and player data

This repository contains data and analysis related to PWHL modeling. The goal is to have a fully functional and fully open-source model (this includes supporting data, by the way) that forecasts PWHL games, full seasons, and maybe even includes things like player ratings.
